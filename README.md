# Ecommerce Web App
A simple e-commerce platform built with Spring Boot (Java 17) and a local PostgreSQL database. The application is tested and documented using Swagger UI on localhost.

About the Project
This project was developed as part of an internship program focused on exploring Java 8 features, Spring Boot development, and RESTful API design.
It simulates a basic online shopping platform where users can browse and purchase products, and manage orders.

# Features
- REST APIs for products and orders
- Java 17 + Spring Boot 3
- Unit tests using JUint
- PostgreSQL (local setup)
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- Swagger documentation (/swagger-ui/index.html)
- Clean layered architecture following Spring Boot best practices

# What I Learned
- Java 8 & 17 features.
- Spring Boot essentials: beans annotations, dependency injection, health check, unit testing
- Lombok usage for entity and DTO classes
- Setting up pom.xml with required dependencies
- Designing and documenting REST APIs
- Organizing a clean and scalable folder structure in Spring Boot
- SQL & NoSQL databases.

# Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- JUint

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a local PostgreSQL database and update application.properties
3. Run the application using your IDE(I used Intellij) or mvn spring-boot:run
4. Access Swagger at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
